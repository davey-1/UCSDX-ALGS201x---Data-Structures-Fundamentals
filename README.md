#UCSD's Data Structures Fundamentals course is a non-language specific course reviewing:
#
#Arrays, Linked Lists
#Queues, Stacks, and Disjoint Sets
#Hashing, Hash tables, and Hash maps
#Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and Splay Trees
#
#The attached documents are my problem set submissions.
#I would recommend another course, perhaps Stanford's on Coursera or MIT's.
